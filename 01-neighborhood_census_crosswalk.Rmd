# Neighborhood-Census Geographies Crosswalk {#crosswalk}

This chapter is fundamental to all of the data that you will curate during the quarter. It explains how to create the neighborhood-census geographies crosswalk, which is a master spreadsheet that links each student's neighborhood to various census geographies - census tracts, cities, and metropolitan statistical areas - that will be used throughout the course. This crosswalk file is for you and your future data curation work, not the students. You do not need to share the crosswalk with students in the class. 

<br>

### When should you curate this data? 
Start creating the crosswalk _after students have submitted Assignment #1 and before the first mapping assignment_ in ArcGIS online (this was Assignment #3 in Spring 2021). It would be the most efficient use of your time to curate this data _while_ you are grading or reviewing Assignment #1, because some of the information that students include in this assignment is necessary for building the crosswalk file. 

<br>

### What do you need to get started?
The folder `nhood_shapes` contains the file and script that are relevant for creating the crosswalk spreadsheet. Specifically, you should open and view: 

- the crosswalk file: `student_neighborhoods_list.csv`
- the R script: `create_neighborhoods.rmd`
- The documents students submitted for Assignment #1 on Canvas.


### Prepare the Crosswalk

**Step 1. Copy the `student_neighborhoods_list.csv`.**

This is the crosswalk file for the Spring 2021 quarter.

*Column Fields* - The first row is a header containing 8 fields that reflect the key pieces of information for the crosswalk. From left to right, the field names and what they represent are:

1. student - The student's name. 
2. nhood_name - The name of the selected neighborhood that the student provides in Assignment #1.
3. tract_id - The full 11 digit census tract identifier (FIPS code - state + county + tract identifiers) that the student identifies as being part of their neighborhood in Assignment #1.
4. city - The name of the city where the student's selected neighborhood is located. 
5. state_ab - The abbreviation of the state where the neighborhood and its city are located. 
6. place_id - The 7 digit place identifier for the census place (i.e., city) of the student's chosen neighborhood.^[The first two digits of the place id are the census state code, which has leading zeros for the first nine states. The script will add the leading zeros that Excel/Google Sheets does not show.]
7. metro_name - The name of the Census Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) where the neighborhood and its city are located. 
8. metro_id - The 7 digit identifier (FIPS code) for the Census Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA).^[The first two digits of the place id are the census state code, which has leading zeros for the first nine states. The script will add the leading zeros that Excel/Google Sheets does not show. For the segregation assignment, you will use a geographic delineation of the Bay Area presented in the course readings, so do not worry about recording the census name or identifier. The script creates the geography for you.]

<br>

*Rows* - Each row in this spreadsheet represents student-neighborhood-census tract. In the example crosswalk file, some student and neighborhood names are on multiple rows. This is the case when the student selected more than one census tract to define their neighborhood boundaries in Assignment #1. 

<br>

**Step 2. Clear the information in the rows below the header and replace with your students' information provided in Assignment #1** 

In Assignment #1, the student will name the neighborhood, city, and state of the neighborhood site they choose to study for the quarter. They will also submit a document from the FFIEC Geocode Report that identifies the census tracts in the neighborhood that they have chosen as well as the metropolitan statistical area identifiers. An example image is shown below.

The numbers highlighted in <span style="color:#32cd32">**green**</span> are the state identifier, county identifier, and tract identifier, respectively. Input them together in the third column. Do not include a decimal point in the tract code (the identifier only contains numbers). 


The text highlighted in <span style="color:#fada5e">**yellow**</span> gives the metropolitan statistical area identifier - a 5 digit number - and the name of the metropolitan area, which belong in columns 7 and 8, respectively.^[Be sure to add the two digit state identifier before the 5 digit MSA identifier when you enter this information in column 7.]

<br>

To obtain the place identifier, navigate to [Social Explorer](https://library.stanford.edu/all/?q=social+explorer&op=Search). Select the _Tables_ option in the left-sidebar menu and then navigate to any survey program (Decennial Census is fine). Select the _Place Geography_ option and begin adding the city names provided by students to the drop-down menu as shown in the image below.

Once you have added all of the cities to the selection, Proceed to the Tables page and export your results, with all geographic identifiers to a CSV. The CSV will have the place identifier in the first column as is highlighted in <span style="color:#00b7eb">**blue**</span> in the image.

**Important Note**: Census geographic identifiers change over time. Therefore, it is important to make sure that the place and metropolitan statistical area geo-identifiers are for the same year as the census tracts. For instance, in the Spring 2021 quarter, the census tracts were still the 2010 boundaries/identifiers, so we used the 2010 boundaries and identifiers for the place and metropolitan statistical area geographies.
